## QBIT White Paper

The QabbalahBit Coin is a Store-of-Value (SoV) & Transfer-of-Value (ToV) Knowledge Network with built-in general ledger (GL) accounting functionality.  We do this using a proprietary technology called Decentralized GL Classes [Copyright (R) The QabbalahBit Foundation]

### Deflationary Token with Strong Network Effects

The QBIT coin is the primary SoV method for a unique community cultivating a research & content production network around esoteric knowledge.

The details of the QabbalahBit Network will be discussed elsewhere, while the purpose of this document is to outline the mechanics & cryptographic incentives around the primary QabbalahBit currency QBIT.

### Limited Total Supply of 611,611 QBIT Coins

This is what makes QBIT a deflationary coin, since with every new coin minted, the total potential supply diminishes causing the opposite effect of inflation, or deflation.

### Immediate Coin Intrinsic Value from Yield Farms & Derivatives

The QabbalahBit Network, currently through its custodian but eventually through a decentralized governance process like a DAO, maintains multiple markets on different blockchains in order to provide as many liquid markets for buying and selling QBIT coins.
